Smart Attendance and Wellbeing Monitoring System
1. Introduction

The Smart Attendance and Wellbeing Monitoring System is a web-based application that records student attendance along with stress and wellbeing evaluation. The system uses role-based authentication, face capture, questionnaire-based stress assessment, and a teacher dashboard to provide complete visibility of attendance and wellbeing data in a secure and ethical manner.

2. User Roles

The system shall support two user roles:

Student

Teacher

Each role shall have clearly defined and restricted access permissions.

3. Authentication & Role-Based Access Requirements
3.1 Login and Registration Interface

The system shall provide a single authentication interface displaying:

Sign In (Login)

Sign Up (Register)

Both options shall always be visible to users, similar to standard platforms.

The system shall not force registration before login.

3.2 Student Registration Requirements

During student registration, the system shall collect:

Full Name

Roll Number (mandatory)

Class / Section

Email ID

Password

The roll number shall uniquely identify a student within a class.

If a user attempts to register with an already existing email or roll number:

The system shall display:
“Account already exists. Please sign in.”

3.3 Teacher Registration & Verification

Teacher registration shall require:

Full Name

Email ID

Password

Teacher Secret Code

The system shall verify the secret code before assigning the teacher role.

If the secret code is invalid:

Teacher account creation shall be denied.

This mechanism prevents students from falsely creating teacher accounts.

3.4 Role-Based Authorization

User roles shall be stored securely in the database.

Students shall access only student-related modules.

Teachers shall access only dashboard-related modules.

Unauthorized access attempts shall be blocked.

4. Student Module Requirements
4.1 Student Login

Registered students shall log in using valid credentials.

On successful login, students shall be redirected to the attendance and wellbeing check-in module.

4.2 Attendance via Face Capture

The system shall activate the device camera after student login.

The system shall capture a face image of the student.

Attendance shall be marked only after successful face capture.

Each attendance record shall include:

Student Name

Roll Number

Timestamp

Attendance status (Present)

Captured face image

4.3 Stress & Wellbeing Evaluation

The system shall evaluate stress using two complementary methods:

A. Face-Based Analysis

Facial features shall be analyzed to estimate:

Stress indicators

Sleepiness level

Mood state

B. Questionnaire-Based Assessment

The questionnaire shall include:

Understanding level of the topic

Sleepiness level

Current stress level

Mood selection

4.4 Final Stress Score Calculation

The system shall compute a final stress score (0–100) by combining:

Face-based analysis result

Questionnaire responses

Stress Level Interpretation Table
Score Range	Interpretation
0–30	Low Stress
31–60	Moderate Stress
61–100	High Stress

The final stress score shall be mapped to qualitative levels for easier interpretation by teachers.

4.5 Student Data Access

Students shall be able to view:

Their attendance history

Their stress scores

Students shall not modify or delete any records.

5. Teacher Module Requirements
5.1 Teacher Login

Only verified teachers shall be allowed to log in.

On successful login, teachers shall be redirected to the dashboard.

5.2 Teacher Dashboard

The teacher dashboard shall provide:

Class-wise attendance overview

Student-wise attendance and stress records

Filters based on:

Class

Roll Number

Date range

5.3 Individual Student Monitoring

For a selected student (using roll number), teachers shall be able to view:

Complete attendance history

All login timestamps

Face images per attendance

Stress scores per session

Questionnaire responses

Stress trends over time

6. Database Requirements

The system shall use a cloud-based database for persistent storage.

Data shall be organized into:

User records

Attendance records

Stress evaluation records

Each record shall be linked using:

Unique User ID

Roll Number

7. Security & Data Privacy Requirements
7.1 Security

Role-based access control shall be enforced at all levels.

Students shall access only their own data.

Teachers shall have read-only access to student data.

All communication shall occur over secure HTTPS connections.

7.2 Data Privacy Statement

Face images and wellbeing data shall be used only for academic monitoring purposes.

Such data shall not be shared with third parties.

The system shall ensure confidentiality and ethical handling of sensitive student information.

8. Technology Stack

Frontend: React / HTML / CSS / JavaScript

Backend: Node.js (or Flask)

Database: Cloud Database (Firebase / MongoDB)

Face Capture: Web Camera API

ML Models: Pre-trained facial analysis models

9. Conclusion

The Smart Attendance and Wellbeing Monitoring System provides a secure, ethical, and human-centered approach to attendance tracking by integrating facial analysis, questionnaire-based stress evaluation, roll-number-based identification, and a verified teacher dashboard for effective academic monitoring.
